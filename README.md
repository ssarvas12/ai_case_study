# OpenAI Case Study 
## Overview and Origin 
Open AI is a private research organization focused on creating and guiding artificial inteligence (A.I.) to serve the greater good of humanity. The company was established by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Ilya Sutskever, and others in 2015. The company was established with two main goals in mind. The first being that the founders's had deep concerns about the possibility of artificial inteligence being used in a potentially harmful or damaging fashion. The second being to continue developing and advancing A.I. into the future, with the goal of continuing to progress and enchance its potential to assist us in our everyday lives. The declared purpose of the company to strive for the development of a safe and secure future as A.I. grows is made apparent by their willingess to openly work with other research groups and individuals in the field. OpenAI was initially funded by the group of technology industry giants who founded the organization - commiting one billions dollars to the project. In 2019, the company shifted from a non-profit model to a "capped-profit" model. After receiving north of 130 millions dollars from donations in the 3 years since its inception, leadership was able to determine that this non-profit model would not allow the company the resources or capital to ensure that it would continue to be able to keep up with the cost of computational abilities, and pay for the talent required to continue moving the company forward. In essence, this new for-profit branch would be essential for the company to continue growing. OpenAI has ensured that this branch would be guided solely by the non-profit branch. In this same year, OpenAI gained a partnership with Microsoft, who pledged a 1 billion dollar donation. In early 2023, the company received a valuation of $29 billions dollars, this figure had doubled from just two years prior. Months later, Microsoft and PwC pledged an additional $10 bilion dollars. Sources report that OpenAI has received a sum of $11.3 billion dollars over 7 different rounds of funding.
